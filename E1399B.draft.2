   1 | What are you most passionate about?                                                                                    
       I am most possionate about how much i know about computers and how much i know about cars. I dont think alot of people 
       my age can say they have changed Oil, tires, or windshield wiper fluid and the list continues. I would even be supprise
       d to find a person at the age of 15 who could list out all the stepos of how to change any fluid on  a car and see them
        do it. My second passion is pc's. i have built two pc's and helped my dad build his. It is very fun but highly timer c
       onsuming and almost seems as if you when you do something simple like changing one of the parts something else is 99.9%
        going to go wrong                                                                                                      
   2 | Do you have any ridiculous goals in life?                                                                              
       Yes I personally do i really want to become profesional in drifting cars and be able to compete with top pros such as 
       ryan Tuerck and Chelsea DeNofa. If i dont start drifting i would just want to have a car I can work on and modify the car
       to whenever i see it I get this burst of joy in my stomach.
